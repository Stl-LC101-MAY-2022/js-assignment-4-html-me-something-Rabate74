      <h1><h1 id="mainHeading">Four adventures I've had!</h1>
          <p>I've been to a few great places so far in my life, but I also have great destinations that I'd like to see someday. I <b>LOVE</b> to travel, and seeing something new is almost cathartic in a way for me.</p>

               <p>I was fortunate enough to visit the beautiful island of Jamaica. My girlfriend was the maid of honor for her best friend's destination wedding. The water was beautiful, and the resort was all inclusive so there was no shortage of fun in the sun. I was able to have my pick between world class pools, or beautiful white sand beaches too. My girlfriend and I were somehow lucky enough to be there on Bob Marley's birthday nonetheless. We each were able to swim in a luminous lagoon that glowed around you when you moved in the water. It was truly breathtaking and I have never experienced something quite like it.</p>

               <p>When I was 19 years old, I had the pleasure of taking an international cruise from Miami to the beautiful Islands of the Bahamas. We were welcomed on Grand Bahama island with endless rum paired drinks called "Bahama Mommas". We were dropped off at the Atlantis Resort for the day that had a swim up bar and a beautiful pool. Inside was a full aquarium that showed off all of the local wildlife. It was truly breathtaking being able to snorkel and see so many beautiful fish. It was just incredible and I'm truly fortunate to have been able to see it with my own eyes.</p>

               <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">Where do I even begin? This was one of the best experiences of my life, and I will absolutely be back. Whether it was getting baptized in the fountain, seeing non stop happy faces, or dancing through the night until the sun came up. I have never had such an incredible experience in one weekend. I was able to see a lot of headliners that could easily sell out their own arenas. While attending Bonnaroo I even saw a wedding on top of a bus! Bonnaroo music festival is truly a magical place and if you ever get the chance to go I strongly recommend you do so at least once. The amount of storys that I have from there could fill up hours of someone's day.</p>

               <p>I have visited the Colorado area a few times. I have been lucky enough to go there about 3-4 times so far in my life and I don't plan to stop. My girlfriend and I took a day trip out to see the Stanley Hotel in order to see the infamous bar from "The Shining". From there we were able to go check out the Rocky Mountain National Park. One of the other more memorable things I did in Colorado was go to Meow Wolf&reg;. It was an amazing experience to see so many different art installations in one place.</p>
